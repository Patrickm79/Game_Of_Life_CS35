## Day 1:

Got pygame to import, after loads of module issues, finally got it to import without a problem, still need to fix
the linter.

Created the game board and cells

Created a class to draw and handle the states of the cell

## Day 2:

Created a less magical solution to Size and Position

Added dynamic scaling so the user can chose window height and cell numbers

Challenging to get dynamic scaling

## Day 3: 

Working on refactoring code to help with the dynamic drawing of the game board and cells

Getting lost in refactoring, miss Swift where "Change all Occurances" actually did that. Having
to hunt down variables in other files is proving to be a challenge.

## Day 4:

Managed to get cell generation to randomize, having issues with getting the program to actually run through...
Implemented pause/play/clear buttons to handle user events in the window, working on a few other bug fixes before presenting.
